# costas-gisweb

Web client application of the geographic information system responsible for managing the public business licenses throughout the coast of Spain. Its implementation is written in Javascript using the Angularjs 1.5 framework.
<p></p>
Some of the most representative features the application provides are:
<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Show the geometry of the licenses on top of a Google Maps viewer using markers.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Show a small description of the license through a pop-up on top of the map. See the detailed information in above the map.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Street view interaction.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Update relevant information of a license.<p></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;● Update the geometry of a license.<p></p>
This application is part of my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering final project. There are two other applications (back-end and mobile client) completing the project:
